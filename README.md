# EPS32 WIFI Access point and App
 
This project was developed as solution for this Freelancer job: https://www.freelancer.com/projects/android/EPS-WIFI-Access-point-App/details

>I am looking for a very basic program that I can upload to an ESP32 and have it connect to a very simple app for you to create that will bluetooth to an android phone and allow me to input an SSID and Password to two boxes and have the bluetooth update the ESP32 with the WIFI credentials and I want the ESP32 to broadcast a wifi access point on those credientials.   If a device connects to the wifi access point I want to just log it in the ESP32 and when the ESP32 connects to the bluetooth again if it isnt currently connected I want the App to have a box saying someone connected or did not connect to the wifi access point
